largest possible sum of values for any path in the tree.

       5
      / \
    -4   6
   /  \
 10    7

 Details:
 * Each node only contains the value and links to its two children
 * You can modify the tree structure if you wish
 * You are only given the root node of the tree
 * The algorithm has to run in O(n)
